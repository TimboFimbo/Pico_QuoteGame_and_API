Could you please provide a json file containing information about popular movies for a personal project?

For each, I would like the movie title, year of release in brackets, director, a list of four actors from the movie, and a well-known quote from the movie.

Here is an example of how I would like the final json file to look. I have only included two movies, but I would like as many as possible, please:

[
    {
        "title": "Pulp Fiction",
        "year": "(1994)",
        "director": "Quentin Tarantino",
        "stars": [
            "John Travolta",
            "Uma Thurman",
            "Samuel L. Jackson",
            "Bruce Willis"
        ],
        "quote": "Any of you fucking pricks move, and I'll execute every motherfucking last one of ya!"
    },
    {
        "title": "The Usual Suspects",
        "year": "(1995)",
        "director": "Bryan Singer",
        "stars": [
            "Kevin Spacey",
            "Gabriel Byrne",
            "Chazz Palminteri",
            "Stephen Baldwin"
        ],
        "quote": "The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he did not exist."
    },
]
